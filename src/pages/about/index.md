### What is a "kerf"?

We'll admit it, we just like the word: **_kerf_**. A kerf is the nothingness left behind by a cutting device (typically a saw, but could be a laser).
Kerfs are important. We make a kerf in the fingerboard to place the frets. We kerf wood so we can bend it. In expensive materials, we want small kerfs to
reduce waste. Without kerfs, we couldn't make guitars, yet a kerf is _nothingness_ -- an **_essential nothingness_**. We think of it similarly to the
famous quote about music: _It's not just the notes you play, but also the ones you don't, the space in the music that gives it its feel and rhythm_ -- the essential nothingness.

### _Why_ is kerf guitars?

I've been playing guitar since before I was a teenager. While I've never been great at it, I've always loved it and guitars have been part of my life
for over 40 years. I've helped friends choose guitars for their friends and family with the sole purpose of making sure that the new, aspiring player
had the best chance of success. You don't need a great guitar but you do need one that doesn't fight back. Many inexpensive "starter" guitars are very
cheaply made and often are difficult to play due to high string action, no attention to intonation, unlevelled frets and so on. This means it hurts to
play them -- it hurts your fingers dealing with the high action and it hurts your feelings that it sounds wrong no matter how much you practice.

I get it, all the companies in the starter guitar supply chain need to make a profit and to get that guitar to you for under $250 means making a lot of compromises. The
problem is that this means many people give up on guitar playing for the wrong reasons. That's not cool -- more guitarists and guitar music means a better world (at least to us). So we're building decent quality guitars that have been carefully tested and setup to help you or the guitarist in your life have the best
possible experience learning and playing.

### How much does a kerf guitar cost?

As much as it needs to. We have day jobs and build guitars because we love doing it. It is not our intention to make a profit. We price the guitars
at our cost and round that up a bit to cover general costs -- sandpaper (lots of sandpaper), drill bits, saw blades, masking tape, strings -- all the expendable stuff we're not going to bother tracking for each guitar. We also don't want to track small differences in finishing costs per guitar -- a sunburst type finish involves more colors (so it's a bit more expensive) than a single color finish but we're not going to charge $15 more for it.

As an example, if we buy a kit from StewMac.com to make a Tele-style guitar (we've made a few of these https://www.stewmac.com/kits-and-projects/instrument-kits/electric-guitar-kits/t-style-electric-guitar-kit.html), the cost is $243, plus shipping and sales tax, puts us out-of-pocket almost $275.
We'll charge $300 for that guitar, maybe a touch more with a gig bag and strap (also priced at our cost). Since we pay sales tax on everything and do not charge for our labor (of love), we essentially sell these as "used", person-to-person, so you don't need to also pay sales tax.

### Paying it forward

When you buy a kerf guitar, you help another one come to life for someone else. We've invested enough to build the first dozen. As each one sells,
we'll use those funds to buy the next set of materials for another one.

Also, we stand behind what we build. Bring it back for a tune-up or string change. We want to keep it (and you) sounding good.

### Do you ship?

Not at this time. Shipping guitars is a whole world of pain (and expense). We're expecting the few million people in the Austin, Texas area to keep
us busy enough for now. We're likely to be willing to bring one to San Antonio or Houston or would be happy to meet you if you are travelling
through Austin.

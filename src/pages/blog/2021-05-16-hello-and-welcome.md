Welcome to the kerf guitars blog! We appreciate you dropping in.

In future posts you will, hopefully, learn things. We'll use this blog to explain how we make our guitars, comparisons of different components (with sound samples), general product comparisons and links to curated learning resources (that we've reviewed and found useful). If you are interested in building guitars, we'll be sharing the things we learn as we continue that journey ourselves.

Doing this sort of thing, we learn stuff and we want to share it. If you'll kindly click the link to "Subscribe for updates", we'll keep you in the loop.

We like writing medium-length posts -- it takes a certain amount of content to explain some things -- but we'll keep this first one short.

We hope you'll join us.

description: At least on one amateur guitar building group on Facebook, there's
  a ready source of StewMac hate. It's common for any reference to StewMac to
  include unkind comments that are only occasionally backed up with pertinent
  personal experience. One area where this happens is guitar kits. The comments
  are generally 'get a cheaper kit on eBay or Amazon, it will cost you less and
  be just as good'. While we don't share the StewMac hate, challenge accepted.
  We'll walk through the whole building process of T-style kits from StewMac and
  BexGears and compare the finished products in a series of posts.

We purchased a [StewMac Tele kit](https://www.stewmac.com/kits-and-projects/instrument-kits/electric-guitar-kits/t-style-electric-guitar-kit.html) ($170) and a similar [Tele kit from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Electric-Guitar-Kits-Okoume-wood/dp/B082ZG8FS7/ref=as_li_ss_tl) ($120 when we purchased). Fifty dollars is real money towards other gear, upgraded pickups or BBQ. We've built a couple of the StewMac kits before and have been happy with the results. In this post, we'll unbox the 2 kits and compare what we see. In later posts we'll continue to share our experience turning these kits into playable guitars.

## Unboxing

Yeah, it's always a bit like getting a present when a new kit arrives...

Two at once is extra special. Let's peek inside:

![two guitar kits, still in box](/img/telecomp-unboxed.png)

Both were packed safely enough, though the StewMac kit (on left) seems to be packed with a bit more care. It's also likely easier to protect parts, like the pick guard, pickups and controls by installing them and protecting the assembled parts. This does mean you have to take those parts off before you can start finishing the body. Both kits include a separate parts bag/box that has the tuners, generic strings and other parts.

## Unpacking

Gathering related parts, let's have a look. The electronics seem to have only subtle differences, at least in appearances.

![electronics parts from two Teles](/img/telecomp-electronics.png)

The StewMac comes with a single color pick guard in black. The protective covering on this one is a bit rolled off one end (first time I've seen this from a StewMac kit). The BexGears features a 3-ply white pick guard with black in the middle layer. Both are of comparable overall thickness. The bridge assemblies are very similar and you have to turn them over and look closely to find much different (the StewMac one has string-through holes, were you to want to do that, where the BexGears does not; the StewMac bridge pickup as a brass backing plate while the BexGears seems to have a steel one). The selector knobs are different sizes.

The one noticeable difference is that the BexGears is wired with connectors so you do not need to do any soldering (depending on your skill level with a soldering iron, that may be a relief to you). 

![two guitar bodies](/img/telecomp-fronts.png)

Per their respective listings, the StewMac body (on left) is solid mahogany where the BexGears is solid Okoume (sometimes known as Gabon for its main country of origin in west-central Africa). The [ESP-Takamine site says](https://www.esptakamine.com/articles/2013636-understanding-mahogany-and-its-variations) "okoume...is softer, and leans toward the warmer side of the classic mahogany tone." It is considered a "mahogany variation". 

The StewMac body has the more traditional routing pattern for a Tele-style guitar, but both will be covered by their pick guards, so that won't be visible after assembly.

![two guitar necks and fingerboards](/img/telecomp-necks-front.png)

The StewMac neck (bottom) is made of mahogany (as is the body) and has a rosewood fingerboard. The BexGears neck is made from maple and has a "composite ebony" freboard. This composite material is used by several manufacturers and is also known as "richlite", an eco-friendly wood fiber composite (essentially a resin-infused paper -- [more details here](http://www.edensaw.com/MainSite/Store1/Store/CategoryHome/736)). They are both 22 fret necks. Oddly for a Tele-style guitar, the BexGears headstock seems more like a Strat-style one. The StewMac headstock is intentionally plain, intended for some customization. We'll be adjusting both of them to match the kerf T-style headstock. Both fretboards seem to have very similarly sized frets.

Bonus for the BexGears neck: there are top-dot fret markers (not shown) and the tuner screw holes (on the back of the head stock) are pre-drilled.

## Preliminary impressions

As I looked at, handled and test-fit the parts, two things jumped out at me:

![two guitar bodies with necks laid across them](/img/telecomp-woods.png)

I could use a very natural finish on the StewMac and it would look nice, since the body and neck woods match and the rosewood fingerboard looks good with the mahogany. The BexGears has 3 different woods, giving it a bit of a parts-caster look out of the box (the Strat headstock on a Tele doesn't help). But at the end of the day, it's *mostly* about how it sounds.

While it's a bolt-on neck, I was a little disappointed to see this much of a gap on the BexGears kit:

So, they are out of their boxes and headed for the workshop. For the most part, I will follow their respective directions and not bring too much of my experience to the party -- part of the evaluation is what would you run into if you were building this as your first kit. If I need to deviate from the instructions, I'll note that in the segments that follow this one.

I'm thinking that the StewMac one will get a cherry red tinted lacquer finish while the BexGears will get a glossy black lacquer finish (should look good with the white pick guard and hopefully with the ebony-like fretboard).  But I'm still pondering that. [Subscribe](http://eepurl.com/hyCJqP) to get notified of updates.

description: Playability is our prime directive. We're not trying to build you
  "the best" guitar (whatever that might mean) or the prettiest guitar (you win,
  PRS). Whatever it is, we want it to play the best it possibly can. But what
  does that mean? Why don't guitars come that way?

Guitars don't "come that way" partly because some aspects of guitar setup are personal preference but mostly, we expect, because manufacturing tolerances in places that make affordable guitars probably aren't tight enough and they don't want to pay someone to adjust the guitars manually before shipping. If you buy an expensive enough guitar, most reputable shops will do a setup before delivery.

Thing is, if you're a new player (or want to be), you don't yet know what to ask for. If a friend, partner or parent is buying the guitar for you, they almost certainly don't know what to ask for. Here's what we do to take that concern off the table when your purchase.

Every guitar we build goes through at least the following measurements/adjustments (as needed) before we even offer it for sale:

* Neck is straightened (we've heard straight necks sound best, so we'll do our best to keep it that way)
* Frets are all hammered to assure they are properly seated (because we're going to work on the frets, so it would be dumb not to do this)
* Frets are leveled (any high spots may lead to string buzz) and shaped (leveling a fret may leave a portion of it a bit flat -- we want a single contact point for the string, not a table)
* We string it up (typically with D'Addario XL Nickel wound 10s)
* Action is set for each string at the first fret (we shoot for medium-low so a light touch will properly fret the string).
* Height of high and low E strings are set for medium-low (5/64" for low E, 1/16" for high E) and the inner string height is set as appropriate for the fretboard radius.
* Pickup heights are set per typical manufacturer's settings or as appropriate for the pickup if it has its own specs)
* Intonation of each string (see notes below) is set so that it results in the best approximation of the correct pitch at any spot on the fingerboard. You don't play only open strings, so why would we only tune/intonate the open string? 

And then we play it. And tweak it if we don't love the sound. For example, the manufacturer's specs can't hear, so they don't notice that the bridge pickup is a bit too loud compared the the neck pickup (on guitars that only have one volume knob, like the Telecaster). A typical setup you might pay for is only going to include the parts after the stringing (you'll pay even more for fretwork, should you need it). 

We make sure all of those things are as good as we can make them before you get the guitar. No extra charge.

We'll explain a bit more about what we do, with pictures, below, should you want more details.

Fret hammering is noisy. The sandbag helps a bit.

Shaping frets is so much easier with the StewMac Z-File. It's shaped so that it does not touch the top of the fret (which is good, given how much time we just spent leveling them).

![file laying on fretboard](/img/shaping-frets.png "preparing to shape frets")

The fretboard straightedge is one of our favorite tools. It is notched so that it touches only the fretboard (a normal straightedge laid on top of the frets can give unreliable results if any of the frets is a bit high). We typically measure neck relief with a feeler gauge at the biggest gap (looking to make it close to zero).

While we did feature a picture of the String Action Gauge (and we do use it for string height and pickup height), good action matters, so we use feeler gauges at the first fret rather than eyeball it.

You may not realize that a fretboard has a radius measurement -- it is not flat, despite appearing so. Your fretboard has a curve to it, edge to edge. And the radius varies by make, style, what have you.  We have a set of radius measurement gauges that range from 7.25" to 20". So if you look at the bridge and the top of the strings seem flat there, this means they are not the correct height off the fretboard across the neck.

As mentioned above, we typically set the correct height of the E strings and then use a radius gauge to make sure the ones in between describe the correct arc. We usually do this by raising the inner strings higher than needed, setting the Es, then lowering the middle strings until they just touch the radius gauge. We actually use a sheet of paper and make sure that it won't slip under any of the strings.

Oh, yeah, intonation -- we promised you notes. We prefer a bridge that will allow individual settings for each string. In the picture above, you can see only 3 screws (they have springs on them) that adjust the saddle back and forth (for setting correct string length). On traditional Telecaster bridges, there are 3 rather than 6 saddles -- 2 strings per saddle. On these, it is only possible to set intonation for one of each pair of strings (typically the high E, D and A). It's possible this is where the phrase "Close enough for rock and roll" came from. We are looking to either find kits that use 6 saddles or a reasonably priced replacement bridge. While we love rock, "close enough" isn't how we roll.

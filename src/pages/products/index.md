  The only reason we're here is to build guitars that will help you or whoever you are buying for have a great playing
  and learning experience. (Oh, and the blog -- we love sharing things we learn. Please check it out.) We probably complete
  a couple of guitars a month on average (you'd be surprised how long it takes, we'll talk about that in the blog, too.)

  After we finish a guitar, we play it for a bit and make sure we're happy with it. We're not going to put it in your hands
  if we don't like how it plays in ours. As we complete guitars and have them in their break-in period, we'll post them below
  along with details about them. Use the contact form to let us know you are interested in one of them and we'll share more
  details about its impending availability.

        The **Drag Queen**: This one is not an original kerf but has been given the kerf treatment. We bought it from a
        maker on the Facebook marketplace for $300. It had good bones (Fender licensed neck and tuners, brass saddles, 
        and a sweet Tonerider pickup) but was a bit unattractive (finish already chipping, ferrules were not in line,
        had an odd, unnecessary pick guard and had some string/fret buzz). We took it apart, stripped and refinished
        the body in that gorgeous pink sparkle and fixed the buzz. That finish cost about $50 (pink, pink glitter and 2k clear).

        Cost is $400 with a gig bag. Available by June.

        This was our first "335" style build (from a StewMac kit). It might also be our last, as finishing these is a lot of
        work and the kits are a bit pricier (see https://www.stewmac.com/kits-and-projects/instrument-kits/electric-guitar-kits/335-style-electric-guitar-kit.html). So if you like this style, grab it as it may be the only *kerf* like this ever made.
        We're willing to make more (it's beautiful and sounds great) but it will definitely depend on interest as we have some 
        lovely LP and Tele style guitars coming that are less expensive.

        Cost will likely be $425 with gig bag. Available by June.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

      The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.

      Kaldi is the place to go if you want the best quality coffee. I love their
      stance on empowering farmers and transparency.

Your guitar deserves to be protected. It's hard to walk around a room, much less around the house, into the car, into the studio for lessons or rehearsals and back again without the occasional bump into something. A good case (soft or hard) can help protect your guitar during these trips as well as offer some extra functionality (carrying your music books, a tuner, etc.). 

We were looking for an appropriate soft case to put kerf guitars in before we hand them to you. We searched on Amazon, read through descriptions for dozens of bags, looked at the specs and reviews and picked two that seemed like the best options. We picked the [Cahaya Premium](https://www.amazon.com/CAHAYA-Electric-Premium-0-5inch-Reflective/dp/B085ZYV5G6/ref=sr_1_6) ($35.86, with additional coupon savings when we purchased) and [Donner](https://www.amazon.com/Donner-Electric-Waterproof-Adjustable-Shoulder/dp/B088M6VQF1/ref=sr_1_9) ($29.99) gig bags for consideration.

The Cahaya is on the left, Donner on the right.

## TL;DR

In our opinion, the extra $6-ish for the Cahaya Premium bag is well worth the difference (when we purchased, the additional coupon made the difference less than $5 including tax). The padding of the Cahaya feels thicker and more shock absorbing everywhere there is padding. The Donner bag's outside storage pocket will not hold a standard sized music instruction book (at least not without cramming it in, perhaps harming the book). The handle on the Cahaya is rounded and feels padded and good in the hand. The partial zippering at the bottom of the Cahaya seems more secure (which might really matter if you are riding around on your bike with the guitar). Details below.

Both bags hold normal size guitars (neither will hold a large-bodied guitar such as a 335 style). Both feature a rubber bumper on the outside at the bottom -- useful as you'll often rest it on this. Both have backpack style straps to make it easier to carry if you need both of your hands or want to shift the weight away from your arms. Both have a normal handle as well.

## Safety Features

As noted above, the Cahaya Premium has thicker, better-feeling padding everywhere compared to the Donner, though either will protect from typical bumps. We'd just feel more confident with the Cahaya. We like the Velcro neck strap in the Cahaya as well -- the guitar will not start to come out of the bag when the zipper is undone.

One additional safety feature we like is the partial zippering at the bottom of the Cahaya. When you think about using the back straps and riding a bike or hiking, having a mostly sewn bottom makes a lot of sense. A zipper can be a point of failure. Without a neck strap, all of the weight of the guitar is supported with that zipper on the Donner.

Contrast that with the design of the Cahaya Premium bag. The zipper open enough to easily insert the guitar, but the sewn nylon of the case supports the weight of the guitar, along with the Velcro neck strap.

Depending on where you travel with your guitar, the reflective strips on the Cahaya case may provide *you* a small amount of safety.

## Convenience Features

Both cases have padded handles and adjustable backpack straps. Both have at least one storage pocket. The Cahaya Premium has several pockets (visible in pictures above): two near the body of the guitar (a larger inside one (which has two other slim pockets) with an outer sleeve pocket and two pockets near the headstock -- suitable for a guitar strap, for example.

One real shortcoming of the Donner bag is that it will not hold a typically sized music instruction book. We tried to put our copy of *Blues you can use* into each bag. It fit fine in the Cahaya, but we could not easily zipper the Donner bag with the same book. You could push in the corners of the book and force it closed, but we'd rather not curl the corners of our books.

We'd never purchased a gig bag before. While it makes perfect sense, we somehow didn't expect them to show up folded into a box. They lost most of the creases quickly.

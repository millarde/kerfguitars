title: How hard of a case?

description: Hard shell guitar cases provide some of the best protection. At the
  low end of that price point, there are options to the traditional hard case
  that blend some of the convenience features of a gig bag with the protection
  of harder case. We'll take a look at two comparably priced but very different
  cases we found on Amazon.

The [ChromaCast Electric Guitar hard case](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A270MZO/ref=vp_d_ac_sub_sp_pd) ($75) is an Amazon Choice for guitar cases at this price point and reminds us of the sort of hard case we've received with guitars we've purchased -- sturdy and boringly functional. This one had a couple of misses we'll describe later. The [ProRockGear Electric Guitar case](https://www.amazon.com/ProRockGear-Electric-Guitar-Case-RG380FC/dp/B008PG8WGU/ref=sr_1_38) ($79) seems to have at least the padding and protection of a hard case with some improved convenience features and some thoughtful design decisions.

## TL;DR

The short version is they are both good cases and will protect your guitar. Between these two, it's really up to what you want from your case. The ChromaCast traditional hard case can be stacked easily n the back of the van with the other gear for the gig where the pocket and strap hooks of the ProRockGear (PRG) case might snag and annoy. But if this is your travel about case (school, work, lessons), the backpack straps and large storage pocket for your music books and gear may be valuable to you. This choice is more about the features that matter to you than the quality of either case.

The ProRockGear case is on the left, ChromaCast on the right.

## First impressions

You can see how the handle on the ChromaCast is not centered. When you pick up the empty case, it tilts heavily towards the long end of the case -- almost uncomfortably so. But it hangs dead level with a guitar inside. That's a nice touch -- not uncommon for this type of case but in contrast to the PRG which has a mostly centered handle and tilts more towards the guitar's body with a guitar inside. Barely interesting if if you use the backpack straps (which are removable, so you don't have to put up with them dangling about if you don't plan to use them).

I've had the joy of being in some bands (and the opposite of joy from all of the loading and unloading of equipment) and I'm pretty sure in that setting, the ChromaCast would be preferred. You can slide it in and out between other gear or stack other things on it. The pocket and strap rings on the PRG would be problematic in that setting. But if I'm going back and forth to lessons or over to a friend's place to jam, the extra storage of the PRG and the backstrap carrying option would be quite desirable.

## Safety Features

This is one of the most important aspects of a hard case -- really protect my guitar as I move about the earth with it. It's largely why you would pay the extra $50 to get from a good soft case (did you see [our soft case review](https://kerfguitars.com/blog/2021-05-22-review-gig-bags-for-electric-guitar/)?) into a hard case. We're not Consumer Reports, so we won't be putting perfectly good guitars into the cases and dropping them down steps or anything. But we've moved enough gear around that we're comfortable saying either of these cases will protect your guitar similarly.

There was one particular design difference that we liked on the PRG case. At the bottom of the case (where you will often rest the guitar when standing it upright), the ChromaCast has a uniform layer of foam at the bottom of the case. This means that the strap button takes a lot of the pressure -- as it sinks into the foam before the foam around it starts to contact and support the bottom of the guitar. Now, it was a shipping incident, not a normal travel incident, but I had a guitar delivered where the composite (not metal) strap button was broken in a case like this (clearly dropped in transit).

The ProRockGear case has a well foamed cutout at the bottom of its case that allows more of the guitar's bottom to be supported by the foam (and still cushions the strap button).

Notice how the thick foam supports the whole guitar with a relief for the strap button. I'm not doing the experiment, but I'm guessing that the busted strap button I got in that shipment would not have been broken in this case. That's just good design.

The fun part is that where there's one good design decision, there are often others. I like how the neck is supported with the PRG case:

![inside of guitar case showing neck support](/img/hardcase-prg-interior-padding.png)

There's about 12 frets worth of molded padding supporting the neck. This also means that there is no way for the guitar to move side-to-side in the case, no matter how hard you drop it. You can also see the extra storage inside the case. Looking at the top of the case, you can also see the extra padding that tops the storage bins and keeps the items where you put them. Keeping with the nice design elements, this section also likely significantly improves the rigidity of the case.

That's not to say the support isn't sufficient in the ChromaCast which also has some inside case storage.

## Convenience Features

The only real convenience feature of the ChromaCast is the traditional in-case storage compartment (which provides some support to the neck as seen in the previous picture). As you can see in the picture below, the ProRockGear case has about twice the internal storage:

Another nice feature of the PRG is that you can get to the storage compartments without lifting the guitar out of the case. There's also exterior storage large enough to hold standard sized music books as well as some cord/netting that can be used to attach additional items.

The padded backstraps are adjustable and removable:

While it's a relatively small thing, the ChromaCast case is about 4 pounds heavier. That's not likely a big thing if you are moving it from the car to the house and back. If you have multiple guitars with cases, the ChromaCast is a bit thinner, making it easier to fit more guitars into the same space.

## Wrap up

There were two things about the ChromaCast that bothered us a little. One is that we didn't seem smart enough to use the keys to lock the case. We put the key in and turned it, felt _something_ happen, but the latch still opened. Not a feature we particularly care about, but things offered should work. The other item seems like a small manufacturing defect that hopefully is only on our case (the Amazon pictures don't show this part of the case, so we couldn't see if it was a standard feature -- we hope not). As you can see in the picture below, the bottom of the case has a "foot" on only one side of the case. Seems like there should be a foot on the other side of the case. This causes it to list just a bit to one side.

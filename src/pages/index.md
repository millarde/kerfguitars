  title: Why Kerf?
  description: >
    Kerf guitars are built with the player's success in mind. Every note should be as easy to play and sound
    as accurate as possible. That may seem obvious, but many inexpensive guitars
    lack a good setup, even a simple intonation adjustment. This means that what you
    think you are playing is not what you are hearing and this lack of correct feedback
    may derail your progress (or simply disappoint).
description: >-
  We love music and we really love guitar music. Kerf guitars are sold roughly at cost.
  Really. We source kits and parts and lacquers and paints and turn them into good guitars.
  It's work we love, so it's not really work. Don't worry, it's not our day job. We think
  of it as a karma project -- we build them so that you have a better experience playing
  and you cover our costs so we can build another one for someone else.

        It actually started as a "service" I used to provide to friends and co-workers.
        Whenever they mentioned they were thinking of getting a guitar for a friend or
        child, I'd beg them to let me help. "Please don't go to the big box store and
        get a starter guitar."

        Because those starter guitars are often barely playable. Even if you 
        pay for a setup (and not many people do), no promises it was done well. So the excited,
        aspiring guitarist gets a difficult-to-sound-good-on-guitar, no matter how hard they practice.

        I used to scour craigslist for the area and look for guitars that seemed to 
        match what they were looking for in general and were in good repair and priced well. 
        I'd send them several links in their price range and suggest they buy one of them.

        And then bring it directly to me. I'd clean it up, put on some new strings, do a 
        good setup on it and make sure that it was ready to delight the new player who was about
        to receive it. And then I decided to take it to the next level.
